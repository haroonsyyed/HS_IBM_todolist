# IBM Full Stack Capstone Project - To-Do List

A full stack web application for users to manage their tasks with a clean and simple interface.

## Why I built this project: 

This To-Do List application allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize their tasks. Users can filter tasks by completion status, sort them alphabetically, and paginate through their list for better task management. The application includes secure user authentication, as well as a responsive-front end and a scalable back-end.
